          title: 'The stack expanded. The work did not disappear.',
          body: 'Every new system added visibility into one slice of the firm, but it also created another handoff. The advisor still has to gather records, interpret the household, draft the note, and queue the follow-up. The result is not a technology gap so much as a labor gap hidden inside the stack.',
        },
        {
          title: 'Advisors became the integration layer.',
          body: 'When the portfolio system, CRM, document vault, planning tool, and email history all disagree about context, the advisor is the person who resolves it. That is expensive work being done by the highest-value person in the workflow.',

          title: 'The opportunity is operational, not theatrical.',
          body: 'The useful AI product is not the clever chat surface. It is the system that reads, drafts, cites, queues, and waits for approval before breakfast. That is where hours return to the team and where household coverage scales without immediately adding headcount.',

          title: 'Grounding comes before generation.',
          body: 'We treat source retrieval as a prerequisite, not a nice-to-have. The system pulls the household records, notes, statements, and policy documents that matter before it drafts a sentence. That keeps the answer anchored to what the firm actually knows.',

          title: 'Citation is part of product design.',

          title: 'Supervision gets easier when the trail is immediate.',

          title: 'It does not answer workflow questions for you.',

          title: 'Buyers should pair controls with product diligence.',

          title: 'Agents are useful where vigilance matters.',
